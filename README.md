# Graph

**Text file format:**
The graph will be read from a text file having the following format:

On the first line, the number n of vertices and the number m of edges;
On each of the following m lines, three numbers, x, y and c, describing an edge: the origin, the target and the cost of that edge.

**Operations:**

**1. ** get the number of vertices;
**2. ** given two vertices, find out whether there is an edge from the first one to the second one;
**3. ** get the in degree or the out degree of a specified vertex;
**4. **iterate through the set of inbound or outbound edges of a specified vertex.For each inbound/outbound edge, the iterator shall provide origin/target vertex.
**5. **retrieve or modify the information (the integer) attached to a specified edge.
